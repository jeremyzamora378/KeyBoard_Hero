# KeyBoard_Hero

## Description 
The goal of this project was to make a keyboard that would react when a user clicks the designated key that is being highlighted on the screen. The application
uses JavaScript to change the highlighted key after being pressed.

### What technology did I use and why ?
This is a frontend web application so I chose to make it a light application that relys mostly on CSS and JavaScript. The main reasons are 
* Type of Application: I needed the website to represent a keyboard that functions when you press the designated keys.

* Scope: Using few JavaScript lines without any frameworks it allows this project to run proficiently. Therefore increasing the scope of the web application,
resulting in no entropy concerns. 

* Good Documentation: For a starter project, it is very important that I document the tools that I use in my projects to be well familiar with the languages that I 
will be using a quite bit more in the future.

*Popularity: JavaScript is used quite often and many times with different frameworks. By using this it gives a wide variety of improvement in the future for this 
project.
 
### Key Features
* Highlight a certain key based on the that is desired to be pressed 
* Change key upon correct press or shake if the wrong key was pressed.

### What challanges did I face, what did I learn ?
* The most challanging thing about this project was making sure that the JavaScript commands would work as expected. I had 
re-write the code multiple times because it wasn't functioning at total capacity.
* I learned that while working with JavaScript it's best take it step by step and because each part plays a major role in 
the final product working correctly.
